Our team comprises of multiple groups who are passionate about bioinformatics and computational biology. We are involved in a number of [research projects](https://sarbal.github.io/binfgroup/projects), and offer projects for both honors and post-graduate students. We are key contact people for the [Bachelor of Engineering (Bioinformatics) degree](https://sarbal.github.io/binfgroup/teaching/) at UNSW, and are happy to speak at external events (e.g., high school and career events).
