        The **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Research Group** has been a center of excellence for bioinformatics research, teaching, and practice since its founding in 2023. Our team comprises of multiple groups who are passionate about bioinformatics and computational biology. We are involved in a number of research projects (links), and offer projects for both honors students (link) and post-graduate students (links). We are key contact people for the Bioinformatics Degree at UNSW (link to teaching), and are happy to speak at external events (e.g., high school and career events).
