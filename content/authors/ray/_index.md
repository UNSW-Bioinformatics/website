I am a computational biologist and bioinformatician, with a current focus on applying computational tools to analyze immune cells in patients with HCV, cealiac disease or blood malignancies treated with CAR T therapy.

I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney, after which I was an ARC Postdoctoral Fellow focusing on wireless communications. I then moved to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where I focused on applying statistical and machine learning tools to viral sequence data, to aid in the design of effective vaccines. My background allows for a unique multi-disciplinary approach to solving biological problems.

I am currently recruiting postgraduate and undergraduate honors students. Please [contact me](mailto:r.louie@unsw.edu.au) if interested.
