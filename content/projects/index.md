<h3>Rational vaccine design using computational models</h3> 

<p style="font-size:14px;">The past few years has seen an abundance in viral sequence data. This information can be exploited for the rational design of vaccines, by building models which capture the sequence patterns in the virus. These patterns can be exploited to find weaknesses in the virus, which can then be used to design effective vaccines. </p>
